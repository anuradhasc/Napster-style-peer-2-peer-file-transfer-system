# Napster-style-peer-2-peer-file-transfer-system
P2P system has 2 components: A central indexing server and a peer. The central indexing server indexes the contents of the peers that register with it.  It also provides search facility to peers. A peer is both a client and a server. As  a  client,  the  user  specifies  a  file  name  with  the indexing server using "lookup". The indexing server returns a list of all other peers that hold the file. The user can pick one such peer and the client then connects to this peer and downloads the file. As a server, the peer waits for requests from other peers and sends the requested file when receiving a request.
